                Current image sharing apps send your photos to a central server which then figures out what other people want to see and sends it to their devices. With pixus images spread organically. You post an image and it gets sent to the people connected to you, as  people like the image it spreads via their connections.

                Pixus uses a number of technologies to allow devices to communicate. 
                Depending on circumstances pixus may connect with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">WebRTC</a> or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/MultipeerConnectivity/Reference/MultipeerConnectivityFramework/index.html">Multipeer</a>.<br/>
                The user of course doesn't have to worry about this.

                On iOS pixus uses multipeer to connect so if nearby people are using the app you can browse each others collections without access to the Internet.
